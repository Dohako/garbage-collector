| **Sweeper/Roller with Conveyor**       | Uses a rotating brush or roller to sweep litter onto a conveyor or into a bin.                                                 | Mostly flat or gently uneven surfaces.                        | - Continuous collection of small/medium debris<br>- Relatively simple mechanical setup<br>- Good for bulk pickup         | - Larger objects (e.g., bottles) can jam<br>- Flexible items (bags) can get tangled<br>- Struggles in very rough terrain |
| **Vacuum-Based**                       | A powerful motor creates suction, pulling trash through a hose and depositing it in a bag/bin.                                  | Flat to moderately uneven terrain (like lawns or parks).       | - Excellent for small/lightweight items (cigarette butts, small wrappers)<br>- Continuous operation                     | - High power draw (large battery needed)<br>- Prone to clogs (plastic bags, leaves)<br>- Noise can be significant        |
| **Simplified Scoop or Forklift**       | A hinged or linear-lift platform to slide under trash and lift it into a container.                                             | Relatively open and even ground, minimal tall grass or debris. | - Fewer motors/joints than a full arm<br>- Handles moderate-sized items effectively<br>- Lower complexity                | - Very small items can slip under or around<br>- Struggles in tall grass or uneven terrain<br>- Limited angle of pickup  |
| **Multi-Joint Robotic Arm (Gripper)**  | A classic 4–6 DoF arm with a claw/gripper to pick items individually.                                                           | More flexible across varied terrains (can reach around obstacles), but limited by the base’s mobility. | - High versatility in picking different shapes<br>- Can reach items in awkward spots<br>- Precise control               | - Complex and expensive<br>- Requires powerful servos for heavier objects<br>- Slower single-item pickup                 |
| **Hybrid: Sweeper + Simple Grabber**   | A sweeper/roller for bulk collection and a small 2-DoF grabber for occasional bigger or awkward trash.                         | Works in typical park/forest conditions, with moderate unevenness. | - Efficient for most small trash<br>- Grabber handles bigger items not collected by the sweeper<br>- Balanced complexity | - Added cost and weight vs. single system<br>- Still can jam on very large or oddly shaped items                        |
| **Hybrid: Sweeper + Vacuum**           | A front brush or roller to gather bigger pieces, plus a smaller vacuum intake for small debris like cigarette butts.           | Mostly flat but can handle moderate debris; brush helps loosen items on uneven ground.                    | - Continuous sweeping plus suction for tiny pieces<br>- Reduces clogs by picking up big items separately                | - Multiple systems = higher complexity<br>- Dual motors (brush + vacuum) = higher power draw                            |
| **Hybrid: Vacuum + Simple Arm/Gripper**| Uses a vacuum for most small debris, plus a short or 2-DoF arm to grab larger items (e.g., bottles) that won’t fit in the intake.| Slightly uneven terrain, can adapt if the arm has enough clearance.                                       | - Suction quickly clears small litter<br>- Arm addresses items too large or heavy for vacuum<br>- Flexible functionality | - Highest power usage (vacuum + motors)<br>- Multiple points of failure (vacuum clogs, arm wear)<br>- Heavier and pricier|
